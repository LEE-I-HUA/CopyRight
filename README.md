### 🍡​collection: index_todo

##### setting_index.ipynb  
→ extract basic case index information  
(getting No, page, pdf, Court, Date, and Title)

- Remember to check the output in notebook and fix some entries (title) manually if needed.

##### circuit_level.ipynb  
→ derive Court Level / Circuit information for index_todo

##### lexis_metadata_extractor.py  
→ enrich index_todo with Lexis-style opinion front-matter metadata

- Extracts structured metadata from Lexis-formatted PDFs:
  - Core Terms
  - Judges
  - Opinion by
  - Counsel
  - Prior history
  - Subsequent history
- Designed to start from the opinion page (`page`) and scan forward
- Used both for single-case testing and batch backfilling
- Does not overwrite existing core index fields

##### index_preprocess.py  
→ post-extraction normalization and cleanup for index_todo

- Removes Lexis footnote markers (e.g. `[*1]`, `[**12]`) from selected textual fields
- Normalizes date-related fields (`Argued`, `Decided`, `Others`) into timezone-aware
  datetime objects (Asia/Taipei, GMT+8)
- Uses batch updates (`bulk_write`) and only modifies documents when values change
- Designed to be re-runnable and schema-preserving (idempotent normalization)

from RST_Preprocessed_SBS
